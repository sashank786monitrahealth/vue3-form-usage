## Basically for our components
#################################

Welcome..

At the end of the last lesson we discussed the importance of incorporating accessibility into your first round of developement. I cannot stress enough: Accessibility is not a secondary task that you come back to after your app is working. It is a primary concern that needs to be addressed as part of your development process.

In this course I decided to keep it separate for educational reasons, introducing one concept at a time and building upon those concepts incrementally. We now have the conceptual groundwork laid out to add in our accessibility features. 

We will go over what I consider some of the very basic accessibility concepts that you need to keep fresh in mind when developing forms. These concepts are not technically Vue-specific, but we will learn how to apply them in the context of our view form components.

Lets dive right in.

### Appropriate Types

In HTML we have a wide variety of input elements to craft our forms, but one element in particular rules them all. The catch-all input allows us the flexibility of creating text inputs, but we can also transform it into checkboxes and radio buttons with the type property.
