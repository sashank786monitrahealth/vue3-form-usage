## Base Radio
#########################

The time has come to tackle the last of our form components for this course, the BaseRadio

Radio buttons in HTML have a unique feature that we need to be aware of before we start building our component - they do not work as a single input,like a checkbox would. They live and function as part of a group of radio buttons that have a single state. 

Depending on the group's state, a radio button maybe active or inactive in relation to those in its own group. 

Due to this particular quirk in how radio buttons work, the BaseRadio component will also have another compoenent to group them, the BaseRadioGroup.


############################
## First, the BaseRadio
############################


We will begin the lesson by crafting our BaseRadio component. The goal is to have a flexible reusable component that wraps a single instance of a radio input, along with its label.

As before, we will first create our component file, BaseRadio.vue, inside the components folder. Then copy the input-label pair for one of our checkboxes from SimpleForm.vue and paste it into the compoenent's <template> block.

#### BaseRadio.vue
<template>
<input
   type = "radio"
   v-model="event.pets"
   :value="1"
   name="pets"
/>
<label>Yes</label>
</template>

#### BaseRadio.vue

Next, we're going to first takle the label. So, let's go ahead and create our label prop, and bind it to the <label> tag as we have done in previous lessons.


################
## BaseRadio.vue -- begin
################
<template>
<input
   type="radio"
   v-model="event.pets"
   :value="1"
   name="pets"
/>
<label v-if="label">{{label}}</label>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  props:{
    label:{
       type:String,
       default:""
    }
  }
}
</script>

################
## BaseRadio.vue -- end
################

Now that the label is dynamic and bound, let's go ahead and make sure that our component can respond to v-model bindings.

We will begin by creating our modelValue prop.

## BaseRadio.vue -- begin
<script>
export default {
  props:{
      label:{
         type: String,
         default:
      }
  }
}
</script>

## BaseRadio.vue -- end

Notice that for the BaseRadio we have set the type of the modelValue prop to be of [String,Number]. This will tell vue that this property can accept either Strings or Numeric values.

When dealing with radio buttons, each button holds the value it represents in the set. For example, if you had a group of radio buttons to select your favourite pet, one radio button would represent dog and another would represent cat.

It's common for these buttons to also represent numerical values. For example, when selecting a number of guests for a hotel room, or even boolean values in their numeric format. 

Let's now go ahead and bind our modelValue property to our input element. Similarly to checkboxes, radio buttons don't bind to the value property, but use the checked property instead. However, in the particular case of radiobuttons we need to check if this button is the one that is currently selected or not. 

Let us go back to our favorite pet example. The modelValue of our BaseRadio elements will contain the user's preference, so either cat or dog - but we need to be able to tell this radio which one of these values it represents. 

In order to do this, we're going to add a new prop to the component, the value.

#### BaseRadio.vue

<script>
export default {
  props:{
    label:{
        type: String,
        default: ''
    },
  modelValue:{
    type:[String, Number],
    default:''
  },
  value:{
     type:[String,Number],
     required: true
  }
  }
}
</script>



#### BaseRadio.vue

<script>
export default{
   props:{
      label: {
         type: String, 
         default: ''
      },
      modelValue:{
         type:[String,Number],
         default: ''
      },
      value:{
        type: [String, Number],
        required: true
      }
   }
}
</script>


Notice that we have not set a default value in the case of the value prop, but instead chose to set the property to required. If this property is not set, Vue will issue a warning for us.

A radio button simply does not make sense when there's not a value attached to it, and a default value could potentially be problematic if the user forgets to set it, and multiple radios end up having the same value.

In order to know if our radio is :checked, we will look to see if the modelValue is equal to value. That means that the user's preference, "dog" for example, will either be equal to this radio's value or won't - checked or unchecked.

Let us go ahead - and remove the old v-model binding and the hard-coded name attribute, and replace it with our checked binding. We'll also make sure to also update the value binding to our new prop.



#BaseRadio.vue -- begin
<template>
<input
   type="radio"
   :checked="modelValue === value"
   :value = "value"
/>
<label v-if="label">{{label}} </label>
</template>
<script>
export default:{
   props:{
       label:{
          type: String,
          default: ''
       },
       modelValue:{
         type:[String,Number],
         default:''
       },
       value:{
         type:[String, Number],
         required:true
       }
   }
}

</script>


#BaseRadio.vue -- end

Almost there! We now need to add the second part of our v-model contract, the emitting of update events. Radio buttons trigger change events when they become the selected option, so let's set up a change event listener with our update:modelValue limit.


## BaseRadio.vue -- begin

<template>
<input
   type="radio"
   :checked="modelValue == value"
   :value="value"
   @change="$emit('update',value)"
/>
</template>

## BaseRadio.vue -- end


Be sure to pay close attention to the payload of our $emit. We are going to emit the value prop. We want our v-model recipient on the parent to hold the value of the currently selected radio button, and because the change event will fire only when the element makes the selected choice, we can safely fire value to update the parent about the newly selected option. 

Finally, because we removed the hard-coded name attribute, we need to make sure that the developer using this component is able to set attributes like name into our input. So, we will use v-bind="$attrs" on our input like we learned when building our BaseInput component, to be able to allow this attribute injection into the correct element.


#BaseRadio.vue -- begin
<template>
<input
  type="radio"
  :checked="modelValue === value"
  :value="value"
  v-bind="$attrs"
  @change="$emit('update:modelValue', value)"
/>
<label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
</template>
<script>
export default:{
  props: {
  label: {
    type: String,
    default: '',
  },
  modelValue:{
    type:[String, Number],
    default: '',
  },
  value:{
    type:[String, Number],
    required: true
  }
    
  }
}
</script>
#BaseRadio.vue -- end

## Updating the demo form -- begin
#########################################

Now that our component is ready, we can go back to our SimpleForm.vue, and replace the two checkboxes with our shiny new BaseRadio component!

### SimpleForm.vue -- begin
<h3>Are pets allowed?</h3>
<div>
<BaseRadio
   v-model="event.pets"
   :value="1"
   label="Yes"
   name="pets"
/>
</div>

### SimpleForm.vue -- end

## Wrapping up

As we've seen, radio buttons have a few quirks that can potentially make them confusing and hard to work with, but we have made great progress in creating a solid BaseRadio component. In our next lesson we're going to take this a step further and create the BaseRadioGroup component, which will allow us to simplify the setting up and creation of the radio button groups even further.

See ya!
